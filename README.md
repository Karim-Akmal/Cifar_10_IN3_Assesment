### CIFAR-10 Custom CNN Project

This repository contains code for a CIFAR-10 classification project using a custom-made Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Introduction

[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is a widely used dataset for image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, making it suitable for training and evaluating various computer vision models.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are a type of neural network designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. They have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies and local patterns in the data.

## Results

Insert your results, performance metrics, or any significant achievements obtained by your custom CNN model here. This could include accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrices, or any other relevant evaluation metrics.

### Fine-tuning

If you performed fine-tuning or experimented with hyperparameters, briefly describe the process and share key insights. Highlight any changes that led to improvements or challenges faced during the fine-tuning process.

## Suggestions for Improvement

Here are some suggestions for improving the custom CNN model:

1. **Architecture Modification**: Experiment with different architectures, layers, or deeper networks to capture more complex features.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, dropout rates, etc., to optimize the model's performance.

3. **Data Augmentation**: Explore additional data augmentation techniques to improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

4. **Transfer Learning**: Consider using pre-trained models or transfer learning techniques to leverage knowledge from other datasets.

5. **Ensemble Learning**: Train multiple models and combine their predictions using ensemble methods for enhanced performance.
