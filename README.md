### CIFAR-10 Custom CNN Project

This repository contains code for a CIFAR-10 classification project using a custom-made Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Introduction

[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is a widely used dataset for image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, making it suitable for training and evaluating various computer vision models.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are a type of neural network designed for processing grid-like data, such as images. They have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies and local patterns in the data.

### Evaluation Results

After testing the model on the test set, the following performance metrics were obtained:

- **Accuracy:** 0.6807
- **Precision:** 0.6845
- **Recall:** 0.6807
- **F1-Score:** 0.6773

### Fine-tuning

Changed alot of layers and channel layers, also did change in the hyperparameters.

## Suggestions for Improvement

Here are some suggestions for improving the custom CNN model:

1. **Architecture Modification**: Experiment with different architectures, layers, or deeper networks to capture more complex features.

2. **More Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, dropout rates, etc., to optimize the model's performance.

4. **Transfer Learning**: Consider using pre-trained models or transfer learning techniques to leverage knowledge from other datasets.

5. **Use Spacial Attention or Channel Attention**: Use any of these 2 types or even both of them between the CNN layers.

6.  **Use Transformers**: Use state of the art models and architectures like Vision Transformers "ViT".
